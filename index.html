  Expressive deformable models like faces have many independently
controlled rig parameters (a). Animators increasingly hand-craft 
in-situ UI layouts for such face-rigs (b). We distill their design 
choices into a set of layout principles (c). We then present an 
algorithm to produce optimal in-situ UI layouts that match animator 
expectation (d); enabling a direct on-shape deformation interface (e), 
where rig parameters can be both independently manipulated (cursor on
white control, top to middle), and best-fit computed (blue controls) 
to match the direct manipulation of the shape  (cursor on face, bottom). 
Our in-situ UI layouts can be further customized 
and refined by animators (f).

<p>
  Complex deformable face-rigs have many independent parameters that control the shape 
of the object. A human face has upwards of 50 parameters (FACS Action Units), making 
conventional UI controls hard to find and operate. Animators address this problem by 
tediously hand-crafting in-situ layouts of UI controls that serve as visual deformation 
proxies, and facilitate rapid shape exploration. We propose the automatic creation of 
such in-situ UI control layouts. We distill the design choices made by animators into 
mathematical objectives that we optimize as the solution to an integer quadratic 
programming problem. Our evaluation is three-fold: we show the impact of our design 
principles on the resulting layouts; we show automated UI layouts for complex and diverse 
face rigs, comparable to animator hand-crafted layouts; and we conduct a user study showing 
our UI layout to be an effective approach to face-rig manipulation, preferable to a baseline 
slider interface.
