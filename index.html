  A complex shape is constructed as the union of 32 solid components. Rather than
resolving the mesh union geometrically and struggling to tetrahedralize the
result, we propose tetrahedralizing each smaller, simpler model independently.
We introduce constraints to join the volume meshes algebraically, enabling
partial differential equation-based geometry processing (<a

<p>
  Complex deformable face-rigs have many independent parameters that control the shape 
of the object. A human face has upwards of 50 parameters (FACS Action Units), making 
conventional UI controls hard to find and operate. Animators address this problem by 
tediously hand-crafting in-situ layouts of UI controls that serve as visual deformation 
proxies, and facilitate rapid shape exploration. We propose the automatic creation of 
such in-situ UI control layouts. We distill the design choices made by animators into 
mathematical objectives that we optimize as the solution to an integer quadratic 
programming problem. Our evaluation is three-fold: we show the impact of our design 
principles on the resulting layouts; we show automated UI layouts for complex and diverse 
face rigs, comparable to animator hand-crafted layouts; and we conduct a user study showing 
our UI layout to be an effective approach to face-rig manipulation, preferable to a baseline 
slider interface.
