  A complex shape is constructed as the union of 32 solid components. Rather than
resolving the mesh union geometrically and struggling to tetrahedralize the
result, we propose tetrahedralizing each smaller, simpler model independently.
We introduce constraints to join the volume meshes algebraically, enabling
partial differential equation-based geometry processing (<a

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Many tasks in geometry processing are modelled as variational problems solved
numerically using the finite element method. For solid shapes, this requires a
volumetric discretization, such as a boundary conforming tetrahedral mesh.
Unfortunately, tetrahedral meshing remains an open challenge and existing
methods either struggle to conform to complex boundary surfaces or require
manual intervention to prevent failure. Rather than create a single volumetric
mesh for the entire shape, we advocate for solid geometry processing on
deconstructed domains, where a large and complex shape is composed of
overlapping solid subdomains. As each smaller and simpler part is now easier to
tetrahedralize, the question becomes how to account for overlaps during problem
modelling and how to couple solutions on each subdomain together algebraically.
We explore how and why previous coupling methods fail, and propose a method that
couples solid domains only along their boundary surfaces. We demonstrate the
superiority of this method through empirical convergence tests and qualitative
applications to solid geometry processing on a variety of popular second-order
and fourth-order partial differential equations.</p>
